# FRUITMATHS APP

Bilingual mobile app (English/Spanish) developed in **Android Studio** and designed to make practicing **basic arithmetic operations** (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) enjoyable and engaging through **gamification**.

## FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY

On the main screen, users enter their name and view the **highest score**, which is prominently displayed to encourage improvement. To make the app visually appealing, a random **fruit image** (an apple, a banana, cherries, a mango, a raspberry or a watermelon) appears each time the app is opened.

The core of the app revolves around solving math problems presented in **levels**. Each level includes multiple arithmetic operations that users need to solve. Correct answers earn points, while incorrect answers result in the loss of a life. Each user starts with three lives, represented as cherries. The game ends when all lives are lost.

To enhance engagement, numbers are visually combined with fruit icons. For instance, if the number three appears in an operation, it will be depicted with three fruits, making it easier and more enjoyable to understand.
